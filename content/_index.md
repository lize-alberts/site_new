      title: 'Mission Statement'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        A primary concern of my research is individual empowerment; designing technologies to help people achieve their goals effectively, while ensuring designers treat people (and their unique needs and capacities) with the respect they deserve. 
        
        My human-centred approach starts with identifying specific problems and finding the most effective and responsible ways to address them, rather than starting with a tool and trying to find ways to utilise it. Thereby, I aim to maximise the benefits of AI and digitisation while minimising unecessary technological dependence and unplanned risks. 
        
        My research integrates psychological theory and big-picture thinking with application-specific empirical research and software design. Informed by my social sciences background and upbringing in one of South Africa's most unequal cities, critically evaluating how technology impacts broader societal issues and basic human rights is another important focus of my work.
