Lize Alberts is an Assistant Professor of AI and Behaviour. Her research falls at the intersection of AI, interaction design, ethics, and social and behavioural psychology <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">link text</a>

Through critical engagement with developing AI and interaction design paradigms, her work aims to steer research trajectories such that technologies treat people respectfully – supporting their autonomy and capacities to thrive, whilst minimising technological dependence. I am also interested more broadly in responsible innovation (RI) approaches for promoting diversity, equality, and sustainability.

Her background spans computer science, the humanities and the social sciences, focusing on HCI, LLM evaluation & alignment, behaviour change, computational linguistics, and philosophy of cognition.
