I am an assistant professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working in the <a href="https://ai-behaviour.nl/">AI & Behaviour</a> group in the Department of Computer Science. I am affiliated with the Netherlands' [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/), supervising PhD research on personalising LLM dialogue agents for sustained individual behavioural support. I am a research associate at the [Unit for the Ethics of Technology](https://www.su.ac.za/en/faculty/arts/centre-for-applied-ethics/technology-ethics/unit-ethics-technology-people) at Stellenbosch University, and an associate editor of the upcoming [Cambridge University Press (CUP) book series on AI Ethics & Society](https://www.cambridge.org/core/publications/elements/elements-in-ai-ethics-and-society). 

My education spans human-centered AI, computational linguistics, HCI, behavioural psychology, software engineering, philosophy, social anthropology, and cognitive science. I have worked at Google as a student researcher on [contextualising the alignment of social AI agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09082), sparking a growing area of research that has since been termed [socioaffective alignment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04532-5). I am currently teaching a new interdisciplinary course on the cognitive and environmental factors that shape human behaviour, and the responsible application of this knowledge in the design of AI/computing systems.

I obtained my doctorate at the University of Oxford, focusing on [the ethics of human-AI social interaction](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f87bbd90-408f-4470-bd75-c94e73650026). My master's thesis focused on supporting [multi-modal grounded language learning in AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14672), drawing from 4E/embodied cognition theories in cognitive science. I have published in several top-rated journals, collaborating with industry as well as universities from across the world. I have been invited to present on my work at Google, Cambridge, and Princeton University. 

A primary concern of my work in human-AI interaction is individual empowerment; ensuring designers treat people and their needs, goals and capacities with the respect they deserve. I draw from psychological theory to understand how to promote individual flourishing while minimising device dependence.
